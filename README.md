Smart Transport Load Balancing System
📌 Overview
This project analyzes package weights for a logistics company to ensure safe and balanced transportation. The program categorizes each weight and applies a personalized rule (PLI) based on the length of my name.
Classification Rules
< 0 → Invalid Entry
0–5 → Very Light
6–25 → Normal Load
26–60 → Heavy Load
> 60 → Overload
 Personalization Applied
Name: Raghavi
Length (excluding spaces): 7
PLI = 7 % 3 = 1
Applied Rule: Rule B
→ Removed all Very Light items from the final plan.
Features
Accepts user input
Categorizes weights using for loop
Applies personalized logic
Counts total valid weights
Counts affected items
Displays final loading report
🎓 Learning Outcome
This project improved my understanding of lists, loops, conditional statements, and personalized logic implementation while following strict programming constraints.
