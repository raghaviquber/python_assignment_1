Playlist Analysis System
Overview:
This project analyzes a music playlist based on song durations and categorizes it as Balanced, Repetitive, Too Short, Too Long, Irregular, or Invalid. It also provides a recommendation to improve the playlist.
Features:
Accepts song durations as input
Validates durations (no value ≤ 0 allowed)
Calculates total duration and number of songs
Detects repetitio
Categorizes playlist
Displays final recommendation
Categories:
Invalid → Duration ≤ 0
Too Short → Total < 300 sec
Too Long → Total > 3600 sec
Repetitive → Duplicate durations
Balanced → Proper duration & no repetition
Irregular → Large variation in durations
Concepts Used:
Lists, conditional statements, logical checks, and inbuilt functions like len(), sum(), min(), max(), count().
Learning Outcome:
This project improved my understanding of data validation, logical decision-making, and playlist analysis using Python.
